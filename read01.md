markdown is a method for formatting on text written in the editor for images and links that are written through 
the repository of the github account and the file is created with the extension .md for each file you add , if don’t that the text will not run with commands. 

__my notes: __

**I researched a lot on how to insert a folder containing many pictures so that
I could use the folder name / the image name. Exe, and url but I encountered various
problems and I hope TA’s explained to him that more clearly**

orderderd list code 
1. mark down is easy to learn
1. contains a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.
1. GitHub supports emoji! like :grinning:

you can add the table of content as like:

~~this~~ is do by markdown not is  by format editor

this table contain some commands that will run in windows terminal
