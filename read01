markdown is a method for formatting on text written in the editor for images and links that are written through 
the repository of the github account and the file is created with the extension .md
__my notes: __

**I researched a lot on how to insert a folder containing many pictures so that**
*I could use the folder name / the image name. Exe, but I encountered various*
problems and I hope TAâ€™s explained to him that more clearly

1. mark down is easy to learn
1. contains a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.
1.GitHub supports emoji! like :grinning:
